def OmegaD_quantum():
    """
    Canonical Qiskit-ready Omega Delta (N)a40) operator.

    Quantum analogue of the classical time-orientation flip: a
    single-qubit phase inversion that reverses orientation without
    altering amplitude structure. Implemented as a Z-axis reflection.

    Structure:
    - Z gate on q0

    Properties:
    - Involutory (self-inverse)
    - Phase-flip symmetry
    - Minimal representation of orientation reversal

    Symbolic identity: N)a40
    Classical analogue: Time-orientation flip operator
    Registry status: Canonical
