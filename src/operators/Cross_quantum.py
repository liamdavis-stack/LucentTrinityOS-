def Cross_quantum():
    """
    Canonical Qiskit-ready Cross (b    Quantum analogue of the Steiner octad 3-cycle acting on three
    8-dimensional blocks in the classical S(5,8,24) system. This
    implementation performs the reduced 3-qubit permutation:

        (q0, q1, q2) b

    Structure:
    - SWAP(q0, q2)
    - SWAP(q1, q2)

    Properties:
    - Order-3 permutation
    - Reversible and unitary
    - Minimal 3-cycle representation in Qiskit

    Symbolic identity: b    Registry status: Canonical
