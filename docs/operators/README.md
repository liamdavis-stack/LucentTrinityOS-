# LucentTrinityOS Operator Catalog

This catalog is the public-facing reference for canonical operators.

**Dual-audience rule (no category mixing):**
- **(A) Mathematical / CS Contract**: definitions, invariants, tests, and reproducible behavior.
- **(B) Symbolic / Theological Contract**: *metadata-only* meaning that does not change mathematical behavior.

If an operator cannot be stated cleanly in (A) without relying on (B), it is not canonical.
