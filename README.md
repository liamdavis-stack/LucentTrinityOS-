## Explicit Commitments

LucentTrinityOS- is explicitly Christian by design.
This commitment is not symbolic or aesthetic; it is axiomatic.  
Certain transformations are defined as lawful, others as disallowed, based on explicitly Christian metaphysical assumptions.
This project does not attempt to be religiously neutral.  
Readers and contributors are expected to engage the system on its own stated terms.
*LucentTrinityOS- is not a general-purpose OS kernel; it’s a Python-based operator/axiom execution framework with a kernel-like dispatcher + sealed registry.*
Sometimes described, half-jokingly, as “mathematical apologetics.”
