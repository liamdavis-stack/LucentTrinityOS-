## Explicit Commitments

LucentTrinityOS- is explicitly Christian by design.
This commitment is not symbolic or aesthetic; it is axiomatic.  

Certain transformations are defined as lawful, others as disallowed, based on explicitly Christian metaphysical assumptions.
This project does not attempt to be religiously neutral.  

LucentTrinityOS is a modular, operator-centric computational framework that formalizes symbolic state transformations through a canonical dispatch system and an explicit axiomatic design model. Implemented as a domain-specific execution layer in Python, the system emphasizes compositional operator semantics, deterministic dispatch, and CI-validated correctness. While not a traditional operating system, LucentTrinityOS functions as a research-oriented runtime for structured transformation pipelines, enabling controlled experimentation with algebraic computation, symbolic execution, and operator governance.
Readers and contributors are expected to engage the system on its own stated terms.

*LucentTrinityOS- is not a general-purpose OS kernel; it’s a Python-based operator/axiom execution framework with a kernel-like dispatcher + sealed registry.*

Sometimes described, half-jokingly, as “mathematical apologetics.”
